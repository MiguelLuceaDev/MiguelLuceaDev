### 👋 Hello, I'm Miguel
I'm a backend engineer passionate about designing distributed architectures. My primary focus is building systems that not only work but are easy to maintain and scale.
> "Complexity is the enemy. My mission is to simplify critical processes through modular microservices and efficient ETLs."
Throughout my career, I've worked on:
- **Microservices Architecture:** Design and implementation of decoupled services using **Spring Cloud** (API Gateway, Eureka, Config Server).
- **Advanced Persistence:** Data modeling and query optimization with **Spring Data JPA/Hibernate**, ensuring integrity in distributed environments.
- **Batch Processing:** ETL process automation and large-volume data management through **Spring Batch** (Chunk processing, custom Readers/Writers).
- **DevOps Lifecycle:** Container orchestration with **Docker** and **Kubernetes**, integrating CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins.
### 🌱 Currently Deepening Knowledge In...
- **Resilience Patterns:** Implementation of Circuit Breakers (Resilience4j) in microservices.
- **Event-Driven Design:** Asynchronous messaging with Kafka or RabbitMQ for inter-service communication.
- **Observability:** Distributed monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
- **AI Automation:** Application of intelligent agents for code optimization and deployments.
### 📚 Education
- **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering** (2018-2022)
  
  Universidad Rey Juan Carlos
- **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering** (In Progress, 2023-2026)
  
  Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC)
  
  *Focus on scalable systems, distributed architectures, and agile methodologies.*
